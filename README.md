# Gender Disparities in Plastic Surgery Academic Papers

### About
This pipeline utilizes generalized additive models (GAM) to predict the expected number of citations by different first/last author gender combinations (male/male, male/female, female/male, female/female). Features include but are not limited to first author gender, last author gender, total number of citations, publication year, and number of self-citations. We compared the expected number of citations per paper to the observed number of citations to analyze gender bias in this field of academia. Data was compiled by Elijah Persad-Paisley of Warren Alpert Medical School at Brown University. All models were coded by Akash Rathi.
